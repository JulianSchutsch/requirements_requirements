It must be possible to move any node to any location required. This should be possible by a
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{set parent} function, assigning a node as a child of any other node
 \item \textbf{up} function, moving the node before its previous sibling, if possible
 \item \textbf{down} function, moving the node after its next sibling, if possible
\end{itemize}
