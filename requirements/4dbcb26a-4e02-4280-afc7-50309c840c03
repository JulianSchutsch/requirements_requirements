Both kinds of contents (Content and Annotation), are split into sections.
A section is a tag followed by a :, like

section : Sectionname

text : Some text

Some tags may be multi line, other only permit a single line.

The empty spaced used between the tag and the : in this document must be omitted in actual use.
